# T1 User Login
Covering U1 - User login

## Scenario 1 - usability test
```
Test cases are different from a Use Case in that we want a real world user to verify that our system 
does what we have developed.

Therefore we write the scenarios with the User (Actor) in mind, and we move away from the system specification style
of a Use Case or Requirement.
