# Test Case

Test Cases should cover whatever you need to sleep well at night (prove that the UseCase or Requirements has been met). 
Normally I do a coverage document mapping all Requirements and UseCases to a TestCase.

There might be overlap, but hey it's an imperfect world...

## Test cases are written by technical staff (developer)
This should be a technical bits and bytes description on how to prove the UseCase or Requirement. 

## Coverage Map

Is as simple as taking all the Requirements, Use Cases and mapping them to a Test Case.

I like to map my UseCases 1:1 to TestCase numbers, but it doesn't really matter.

| R or U | T  |
|--------|----|
| U1     | T1 |
| R1     | T2 |
| R2,R5  | T3 |
