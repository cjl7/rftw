# Test Case

Test Cases should cover whatever you need to sleep well at night. Normally I do a coverage document mapping all Requirements and UseCases to a TestCase.

There might be overlap, but hey it's an inperfect world...


## Coverage Map

Is as simple as taking all the Requirements, Use Cases and mapping them to a Test Case.

I like to map my UseCases 1:1 to TestCase numbers, but it doesn't really matter.

|R or U|T|
|---|---|
|U1|T1|
|R1 | T2 |
|R2,R5| T3|
