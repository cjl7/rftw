# Requirements ftw

You need to do requirements, just do it! Stop procrastinating...

Why is it so hard to create good requirements? And why do we accept to work
without a clear, common view on what is supposed to be done?

This repo is just my way of trying to present a simple and clear way of getting
over the *requirements anxiety*.

## Process

There is a 4-step process for this to be successful.

1. Vision
1. Requirements
1. Use Case
1. Test Case

### Vision

This is the high level idea on what the project is going to achieve. Per
definition this is not a technical description, but rather an idea, vision in
plain English (or whatever language you speek).

It can be as simple as _I'm going to fly to the moon_

### Requirements

Requirements are a non-technical description of a single "thing" that you want to happen. They can be *Functional* or *Non-Funktional*, but it really doesn't matter for the process which it is. I recommend not to name requirements as ```FR1``` (Functional Requirement 1), but rather just ```R1```.

Requirements can also be Legal, Constraints, or basically anything you want to happen, or not.

### Use Cases

Use Cases are used to iron out any questions or ambiguity about the Requirements. A Use Case should be understood equally by person a or b. Any and all questionmarks needs to be removed, any need to interpet the Use Case must be removed.

Use Cases are non-technical, and should use plain English (non-technical terms) as much as possible.

Why, you wonder? - Use Cases is the last step where non-technical persons has any input on **what** is supposed to happen.

### Test Cases

Test Cases are just the prof that the Use Case works. There is often a 1:1 relationship between Use Case and Test Case.

i.e. R1 -> T1


## Naming Convention

Requirements, Use Cases and Test Cases should be numbered and prefixed with
```
Requirements: R
Use Cases: U
Test Cases: T
```

So Use Case #1 would be *U1*, or optionally *U1-\<short desc>* 

## Examples

I have put together some examples to get you going.
